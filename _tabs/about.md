Hey there! I’m **Soufiane Lahlali**, a **24-year-old cybersecurity enthusiast and penetration tester**. I’m **open to work** as a **Cybersecurity Consultant** or **Penetration Tester**, bringing my passion to every challenge.

Every single day, I push my limits on **[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)** and **[HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/)**, sharpening my skills in **web penetration testing, Active Directory exploitation, and much more**. I believe that growth comes from persistence, so I’m constantly learning, adapting, and breaking barriers in cybersecurity.

Right now, I’m on a mission to earn the **CRTA certification**, leveling up my expertise in **Active Directory pentesting**. My goal? To not just master my craft, but to help secure systems and make the digital world a safer place.
